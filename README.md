This script is designed to monitor Telegram conversations for specific keywords related to drugs and substances.
It uses the Telethon library to interact with the Telegram API and retrieve messages from a specified chat.
The script then performs keyword matching on the retrieved messages and prints the results with an alert level based on the count of matched keywords.
Additionally, the script generates random IP addresses and Indian phone numbers for two persons involved in the conversation.
